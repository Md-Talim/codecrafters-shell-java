# 🐚 Build Your Own Shell in Java

This is a custom implementation of a POSIX-compliant shell written in Java. It interprets shell commands, runs external programs, and supports built-in commands like `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, and more. The shell also supports command parsing, I/O redirection, and autocompletion.

This project is part of the [**"Build Your Own Shell" Challenge by Codecrafters**](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview). It helped me understand how real-world shells like Bash or Zsh work under the hood while sharpening my Java skills.

## 📌 What This Project Does

This Java shell:

- Accepts user input to execute shell commands.
- Implements built-in commands like `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, `exit`, and `type`.
- Supports running external programs by resolving system `PATH`.
- Handles input/output/error redirection (e.g., `>`, `>>`, `2>`).
- Offers command autocompletion using the `Tab` key.

---

## ⚙️ How to Set Up and Run

### Prerequisites

- **Java 23**
- **Maven**
- **Linux-based system** (for POSIX support)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Md-Talim/codecrafters-shell-java.git
cd codecrafters-shell-java

# Build the project
mvn clean package

# Run the shell
./your_program.sh
```

### Usage

- You'll see a prompt like `$`
- Enter commands like `pwd`, `echo Hello`, `ls`, or `cd ..`
- Press `Ctrl + D` to exit

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Built-in Commands**:
  - `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, `exit`, `type`
- **External Commands**:
  - Uses `ProcessBuilder` to run commands found in the system `PATH`
- **Redirection**:
  - `>`, `>>`, and `2>` supported
- **Autocompletion**:
  - Pressing `Tab` suggests available commands and executables
- **Terminal Control**:
  - Uses raw input mode for better interactivity

## 🔍 How It Works Internally

| Component              | Responsibility                                      |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `Parser.java`          | Breaks input into tokens, handles redirection       |
| `Shell.java`           | Main shell logic, orchestrates commands             |
| `CommandRegistry`      | Registers and manages built-in commands             |
| `ExternalCommand.java` | Executes non-built-in programs via `ProcessBuilder` |
| `Redirection.java`     | Handles output and error redirection                |
| `AutoCompleter.java`   | Suggests commands during typing                     |
| `Termios.java`         | Enables raw terminal mode via JNA                   |

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Java 23**
- **Maven**
- **JNA (Java Native Access)**
- **POSIX standards** for terminal and process behavior

## 💡 Challenges & Lessons Learned

### Challenges

- 🧩 **Command Parsing**: Handling quotes, escapes, and operators
- 🔁 **Redirection**: Syncing output streams to files accurately
- ⚡ **Autocompletion**: Real-time feedback and correct suggestions
- 🧠 **Terminal Control**: Raw mode and disabling echo with JNA

### Lessons Learned

- Internal working of Unix-like shells
- Parsing and interpreting command-line input
- Running processes and managing I/O in Java
- Working with native system APIs using JNA
- Structured thinking and debugging complex workflows

## 🛠️ Why I Built This Project

- To understand how Bash/Zsh-like shells work under the hood
- To practice writing clean, modular, and testable Java code
- To solve a real-world systems-level problem from scratch
- To push my boundaries with parsing, process control, and terminal I/O

This project helped me grow as a backend/systems engineer and is one of my favorite learning experiences.
